This is me learning how to use the libraries chess and stockfish, which are both going to eventually be used to make a chess game.
The reason I am making this is because in my college chess is blocked, and because I enjoy chess, I want to play it, so I am going to make it in python using pygame.


First thing to know is how the Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) works, bellow is how the fields work.
Also something to know is how the universal chess interface (uci) notation works

A FEN record contains six fields, each separated by a space. The fields are as follows:

    Piece placement data: Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1, with a "/" between each one; within each rank, the contents of the squares are described in order from the a-file to the h-file. Each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names in algebraic notation (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K"). White pieces are designated using uppercase letters ("PNBRQK"), while black pieces use lowercase letters ("pnbrqk"). A set of one or more consecutive empty squares within a rank is denoted by a digit from "1" to "8", corresponding to the number of squares.
    
    Active color: "w" means that White is to move; "b" means that Black is to move.
    
    Castling availability: If neither side has the ability to castle, this field uses the character "-". Otherwise, this field contains one or more letters: "K" if White can castle kingside, "Q" if White can castle queenside, "k" if Black can castle kingside, and "q" if Black can castle queenside. A situation that temporarily prevents castling does not prevent the use of this notation.
    
    En passant target square: This is a square over which a pawn has just passed while moving two squares; it is given in algebraic notation. If there is no en passant target square, this field uses the character "-". This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to capture en passant. An updated version of the spec has since made it so the target square is recorded only if a legal en passant capture is possible, but the old version of the standard is the one most commonly used.

    Halfmove clock: The number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance, used for the fifty-move rule.
    
    Fullmove number: The number of the full moves. It starts at 1 and is incremented after Black's move.

The UCI notation has 3 fields without seperation and it works as follows:

    The first chess piece location is described, which for example d2 which in the starting position is the queenside pawn.
    The second chess piece location is then described, which following the example above would be d4 which would move the queenside pawn forward 2.
    The third field is for if it is a promotion of a pawn, and if so, what it is promoting to, for example it would be q which is it promoting to a queen.

    All of this together would show d2d4 for a standard move, and if it was a promotion it would be something like d7d8q.

    Promotion: noting from above, the third field can be put as any of the types of pieces that you may want, it can be one of r (rook), n (knight), b (bishop) or q (queen). It would be put at the end of the uci notation unless no promotion will occur, which then it would not be put down.

    Castling: If there is a need to castle, when following chess rules you would do e1c1 for queenside, and e1g1 for kingside, it would be different for black's castling as it is on the opposite side of the board.

    

Engines that could be used/should be learnt:
maia chess
stockfish
maybe crazyara

Below shown is the link for the documentation for the chess library:
https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

and also you will need to download stockfish:
https://stockfishchess.org/

which you would need to link the path of the executable to stockfish so you can use it:

```
stockfish = Stockfish(r"M:\stockfish\stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe")
```
